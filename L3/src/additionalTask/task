Собственная Hashtable.
Реализовать метод вставки в
собственном классе SimpleHashtable

The task you mentioned is asking you
to implement your own version of a hash table
and specifically to implement
a method for inserting data
into this custom hash table class.

In other words, you're being asked
to create a simplified version of
a hash table data structure
and provide a way to insert data into it.

Here's what you can do to fulfill this task:

Create a Custom Hashtable Class:
Start by creating a new class,
let's call it SimpleHashtable,
that will serve as your custom hash table.

Implement a Hashing Function:
Hash tables use a hashing function
to map keys to specific indices in an array.
Implement a simple hashing function
that takes a key and
returns an index where
the value associated with that key
will be stored in the array.

Implement the Insertion Method:
In your SimpleHashtable class,
create a method (let's say insert)
that takes a key and a value as parameters.

In this method,
calculate the hash value for the key
using your hashing function,
and then store the value
at the corresponding index in the array.

This is a very basic example to give you an idea.
In practice, hash tables handle
collisions,
resizing,
and other factors that can make them more complex.
Depending on the specifics of your task
and your class's requirements,
you might need to add
collision handling, resizing, and more.

Remember to adapt the code to your specific task and requirements.
